# clj-oauth2

This library implements the OAuth 2.0 protocol for the Clojure
programming language. Currently, only the client side is implemented
and of that only the "Authorization Code" grant type. It aims to
comply with the future [RFC which is currently in draft
status](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-12) but also
contains work-arounds for popular but non-compliant OAuth 2.0
implementations such as Facebook to be practical.

clj-oauth2 wraps clj-http for accessing protected resources.

## Basic Usage

    (:require [clj-oauth2.client :as oauth2])

    (def facebook-oauth2
      {:authorization-uri "https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize"
       :access-token-uri "https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token"
       :redirect-uri "http://example.com/oauth2-callback"
       :client-id "1234567890"
       :client-secret "0987654321"
       :access-query-param :access_token
       :scope ["user_photos" "friends_photos"]
       :grant-type 'authorization_code})

    ;; redirect user to (:uri auth-req) afterwards
    (def auth-req
      (oauth2/make-auth-request facebook-oauth2 "some-csrf-protection-string"))


    ;; auth-resp is a keyword map of the query parameters added to the
    ;; redirect-uri by the authorization server
    ;; e.g. {:code "abc123"}
    (def access-token
      (oauth2/get-access-token facebook-oauth2 auth-resp auth-req))

    ;; access protected resource
    (oauth2/get "https://graph.facebook.com/me" {:oauth2 access-token})

## Ring Middleware

    (:require [clj-oauth2.client :as oauth2]
              [clj-oauth2.ring :as oauth2-ring])

    (def login-uri
      (get (System/getenv) "LOGIN_URI" "https://login.salesforce.com"))

    (def force-com-oauth2
      {:authorization-uri (str login-uri "/services/oauth2/authorize")
       :access-token-uri (str login-uri "/services/oauth2/token")
       :redirect-uri (System/getenv "REDIRECT_URI")
       :client-id (System/getenv "CLIENT_ID")
       :client-secret (System/getenv "CLIENT_SECRET")
       :scope ["id" "api" "refresh_token"]
       :grant-type "authorization_code"
       :force-https (System/getenv "FORCE_HTTPS") ; on Heroku the app thinks it is always http
       :trace-messages (Boolean/valueOf (get (System/getenv) "DEBUG" "false"))
       :get-state oauth2-ring/get-state-from-session
       :put-state oauth2-ring/put-state-in-session
       :get-target oauth2-ring/get-target-from-session
       :put-target oauth2-ring/put-target-in-session
       :get-oauth2-data oauth2-ring/get-oauth2-data-from-session
       :put-oauth2-data oauth2-ring/put-oauth2-data-in-session
       :exclude #"^/public.*"})

     ; This is the mapping of URL paths to actions
     (defroutes handler
       ; Just do a 'describe' on the Account object and dump the resulting
       ; output
       (GET "/" 
         {params :params session :session oauth :oauth} 
     	   (let [url (str 
     	               (:instance_url (:params oauth)) 
     	               "/services/data/v24.0/sobjects/Account/describe/")
     	         response (oauth2/get url {:oauth2 oauth})]
       		{:headers {"Content-type" "text/plain; charset=UTF-8"}
       		 :body (with-out-str (pprint response))}))
       (route/files "/public" {:root "www/public"})
       (route/not-found "Page not found"))

     ; Set up the wrappers
     (def app 
     	(-> handler 
     		(wrap-oauth2 force-com-oauth2)
     		wrap-session 
     		wrap-keyword-params
     		wrap-params))

     (defn -main []
       (let [port (Integer/parseInt (get (System/getenv) "PORT" "8080"))]
     	    (jetty/run-jetty app {:port port})))
